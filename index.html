                <p class="section-content">Quentin Jerome Tarantino is an American filmmaker and actor. His films are
                    characterized by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, an aestheticization of violence,
                    extended scenes of dialogue, ensemble casts consisting of established and lesser-known performers,
                    references to popular culture and a wide variety of other films, soundtracks primarily containing
                    songs and score pieces from the 1960s to the 1980s, and features of neo-noir film.</p>

                        Both The Guardian and The Telegraph awarded the film five stars, with the former’s critic Peter
                        Dowling describing the movie as “shocking, gripping, dazzlingly shot” and “entirely outrageous,
                        disorientating, irresponsible, and also brilliant”.</p>

            <p class="section-content">Plot details have been kept largely under wraps for Once Upon a Time in
                Hollywood, but Tarantino has previously said that the film will be “a story that takes place in Los
                Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood.

                The two lead characters are Rick Dalton (DiCaprio), former star of a Western TV series, and his longtime
                stunt double Cliff Booth (Pitt). Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise
                anymore. But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbour… Sharon Tate.”

                This latest trailer gives a better idea of the plot, with Dalton worried he’s become a has-been and
                Pitt’s Booth introduced to Manson and his “family”.</p>
